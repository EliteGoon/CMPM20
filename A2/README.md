Encroachment
------------

Use the arrow keys to move, and the spacebar to restart.

The game code is split between three files:
* 'main.js' for main game loop, some draw functions
  and key press detection
* 'game.js' for the game state object and game object
  class, along with various functions to draw, add,
  and alter buildings and food, checking for overlap
* 'snake.js' for all functions and objects pertaining
  to the snake and its segments, including moving,
  hit detection, and drawing for the snake

The only external library used was jQuery 1.11.2, a free and
open source library for JavaScript that simplifies some HTML
scripting.  This file has been included for convenience.

PLEASE NOTE: None of the art assets used in this game are my
intellectual property.  They were all taken off of the web
with only minor modifications by myself.  Please let me know
this is unacceptable practice for future assignments.
